Search, share, and save BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals)

`bips.dev` is a static site generated by [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola), using the [bitcoin/bips](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips)
repo as input. The result is a site that enables a simple UI for navigating BIPs, searching, and sharing them easily via short URLs, i.e.
[`https://bips.dev/141`](https://bips.dev/141)
