<h2> Abstract </h2>


This BIP proposes to add consensus support for a new tapscript opcode that enables a new type of output restrictions:
`OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` (`OP_CCV`).

This opcode enables users to create UTXOs that carry a dynamic commitment to a piece of data. The commitment can be
validated during the execution of the script, allowing introspection to the committed data. Moreover, a script can
constrain the internal public key and taptree of one or more outputs, and possibly the committed data.

In conjunction with an opcode for _vector commitments_<ref>_Vector commitments_ are cryptographic primitives that
allow to commit to a vector of values via a single short value. Hashing and concatenation trivially allow to commit to
an entire vector, and later reveal all of its elements. Merkle trees are among the simplest efficient vector
commitments, allowing to reveal individual elements with logarithmically-sized proofs.</ref>, this allows to create and
compose arbitrary state machines that define the possible future outcomes of a UTXO. The validity of a state transition
depends on the conditions that can be expressed in the program (scripts in the taptree).

<h3> Motivation </h3>


The ability to constrain the future of coins beyond what is possible with presigned transactions is at the core of
numerous attempts to improve bitcoin. Some of the proposed applications include:

*  UTXO sharing schemes like Ark, CoinPools, Timeout Trees, etc. use various types of output restrictions in order to enable multiple parties to share the control of a UTXO, while ensuring that each participant controls their own balance.
*  `OP_VAULT`<sup id="cite_ref_1"><a href="#cite_ref_1">1</a></sup> is a proposed opcode to implement a 2-step withdrawal process, enabling on-chain reactive security.
*  `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY`<sup id="cite_ref_2"><a href="#cite_ref_2">2</a></sup> is a long-proposed opcode to constrain a transaction to a _template_ with a fixed set of outputs.
*  Sidechains and rollups could be implemented via a UTXO encumbered with a recursive covenant, updating the sidechain state root every time it is spent.


Constructions like BitVM<sup id="cite_ref_3"><a href="#cite_ref_3">3</a></sup> try to side-step the lack of a primitive allowing UTXOs to carry
state with a clever use of Lamport Signatures, and optimistic execution of smart contracts. This comes with an extremely
high cost in term of complexity, interactivity, and (potentially) in block size occupation, for some of the possible
execution paths. Moreover, the design of fully trustless bridges remains elusive.

Rather than providing a construct optimized for a specific application, this BIP aims to provide a fundamental building
block that is widely applicable, and common to many constructions.

<h2> Design </h2>


`OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` is an implementation of a new primitive that could be called
_state-carrying UTXOs_. It allows to embed a commitment to a piece of data in a UTXO, and to validate it during the
execution of the script, and _carry_ a (possibly dynamically computed) piece of data to the new UTXOs that are
produced.

We consider the _program_ of a P2TR UTXO to be composed of an x-only public key (that we call the _naked key_), and
a Merkle tree of scripts. If there is no data committed in the UTXO, then the naked key is the internal key as defined
in BIP-341.

If the UTXO carries a commitment to a 32-byte hash (the _data_), the naked key is tweaked with a hash of the data.
The resulting key is the taproot internal key per BIP-341.

This allows to embed a commitment to the data that can be validated during the script execution, while staying fully
compatible with taproot. Notably:
*  the committed data does not make the UTXO any larger;
*  the keypath spend is still available to any party that possesses the private key of the naked key, as long as they have knowledge of the embedded data (or at least the data’s hash)<ref>For example, in a multi-party contract, the naked key could be an aggregate key using <a href="/327" target="_blank">MuSig2</a>; the taproot keypath would therefore allow a _cooperative_ spend, without executing any script at all. Like for all taproot transactions, this is indeed the

```
  cheapest way of spending the UTXO — albeit not always possible in practice.</ref>;
* if multiple scripts are in different leaves of the taptree, only the ones that actually need to access the data have to pay a cost for it, in terms of additional witness bytes.
```


`OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` can be applied to introspect the program and data of one of the inputs of the
transaction (typically, the UTXO being spent, in order to access its committed data), or one of the outputs of the
transaction (in order to define its program, and possibly its committed data).

<h3> Output amounts </h3>


When checking the script of one or more outputs with `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY`, it is usually necessary to
also check that the amount of the current input (that is, the UTXO being spent) is correctly distributed among the
outputs in the expected way. Therefore, the opcode already includes an amount semantic that covers the common use cases.

There are three supported modes for the opcode when checking an output, depending on the value of the `mode`
parameter:
*  _default_: the residual amount of the current input must be preserved in the output (aggregate across the inputs that specify the output);
*  _ignore_: the output amount is ignored.
*  _deduct_: the amount of the checked output is subtracted from the amount of the current input (the residual amount is then available for further checks);


The _default_ logic covers the common case where a UTXO’s full amount is required to be sent to a specific output.

The _deduct_ logic allows to assign portions of the input amount to one or more outputs; the residual amount, checked
with a final check using the _default_ logic, can be used to enforce that the total amount is preserved.

The following figures illustrate some common examples of supported use cases for the amount logic. This list is not
exhaustive, as there are many more possible combinations.

**Remark:** validation fails if the amount of an output is checked with both the _default_ and the _deduct_ logic
in the same transaction, or multiple times with the _deduct_ logic. This prevents duplicate or inconsistent counting
of the same amounts.

**Remark:** it is allowed to check for multiple inputs to check the same output with the _default_ logic. This
allows multiple inputs to aggregate (in full or in part) their amounts to the same output.

-----

<img src="bip-0443/amount_example_1.png" />
**Figure 1:** A UTXO `A` sends the entire amount to some output contract `B`, using `CCV` with the <i>default</i> semantic.

-----

<img src="bip-0443/amount_example_2.png" />
**Figure 2:** Three UTXOs aggregate their amounts towards the same output contract, using `CCV` with the <i>default</i> semantic.

-----

<img src="bip-0443/amount_example_3.png" />
**Figure 3:** A UTXO `A` sends a portion of its amount to a contract `A'` identical to itself, and the rest to a different contract `B`. It would use `CCV` to introspect its own input's program, then to check the first output with the <i>deduct</i> semantic, then to check the second output with the <i>default</i> semantic to assign the residual amount.

-----

<img src="bip-0443/amount_example_4.png" />
**Figure 4:** Similar to the previous example, but a second input `B` also checks the same output `X` with the <i>default</i> semantic, aggregating its input with the residual amount of the first input.

-----

Note that the _deduct_ semantic does not allow to check the exact amount of its output. Therefore, in contracts using
a scheme similar to figure 3 or 4 above, amounts should be constrained either with a signature, or with future
introspection opcodes that allow fixing the amount. In lack of that, amounts would be malleable.

<h2> Specification </h2>


The tapscript opcode `OP_SUCCESS187` (`0xbb`) is constrained with new rules to implement
`OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY`.

When evaluating `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` (`OP_SUCCESS187`,
`0xbb`), the expected format of the stack, shown bottom-to-top, is:

```
<data> <index> <pk> <taptree> <mode>
```

where:

*  `<mode>` is a minimally encoded integer, according to one of the values defined below.
*  `<taptree>` is the Merkle root of the taproot tree, or a minimally encoded `-1`, or the empty buffer.
*  `<pk>` is called the _naked key_, and it's a valid 32-byte x-only public key, or a minimally encoded `-1`, or the empty buffer.
*  `<index>` is a minimally encoded -1, or a minimally encoded non-negative integer.
*  `<data>` is a buffer of arbitrary length.


In short, the semantics of the opcode with respect to the script can be summarized as follows:

<blockquote>
Verify that the input/output with the given 'index' is a P2TR UTXO whose taproot output key is obtained from 'pk',
tweaked with the hash of 'data' (if non-empty), then taptweaked with 'taptree' (if non-empty).
</blockquote>

If the `<data>` is non-empty, then the additive tweak for the data is computed as:

```
  data_tweak = sha256(pk || data)
```

In the following, the _current input_ is the input whose script is being executed.

The following value of the `<mode>` are defined:
*  `CCV_MODE_CHECK_INPUT = -1`: Check an input's script; no amount check.
*  `CCV_MODE_CHECK_OUTPUT = 0`: Check an output's script; preserve the (possibly residual) amount.
*  `CCV_MODE_CHECK_OUTPUT_IGNORE_AMOUNT = 1`: Check an output's script; ignore amounts.
*  `CCV_MODE_CHECK_OUTPUT_DEDUCT_AMOUNT = 2`: Check an output's script; deduct the output amount from the input's residual amount.


Any other value of the `<mode>` makes the opcode succeed validation immediately for the current
input<ref>This allows to soft-fork future behavior by introducing new values for the `<mode>`. As the mode
would always be hard-coded via a push in the script, the risk of mistakes seems negligible.</ref>.

The following values of the other parameters have special meanings:
*  If the `<taptree>` is -1, it is replaced with the Merkle root of the current input's tapscript tree. If the taptree is the empty buffer, then the taptweak is skipped.
*  If the `<pk>` is 0, it is replaced with the NUMS x-only pubkey `0x50929b74c1a04954b78b4b6035e97a5e078a5a0f28ec96d547bfee9ace803ac0` defined in BIP-0340. If the `<pk>` is -1, it is replaced with the taproot internal key of the current input.
*  If the `<index>` is -1, it is replaced with the index of the current input.
*  If the `<data>` is the empty buffer, then there is no data tweak for the input/output being checked.


Any other value of the `<taptree>`, `<pk>`, `<index>` or `<data>` parameters
is invalid, and makes the opcode immediately fail validation.

<h3> Script support for <code>OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY</code> </h3>


The specification is divided into three parts:
*  the transaction-wide initialization;
*  the input initialization;
*  the opcode evaluation.


The following helper function is a version of `taproot_tweak_pubkey`, except that a raw 32-byte data is used
as the tweak.

```
def tweak_embed_data(pubkey, data):
    assert len(pubkey) == 32

    data_tweak = sha256(pubkey + data)

    t = int_from_bytes(data_tweak)
    if t >= SECP256K1_ORDER:
        raise ValueError
    P = lift_x(int_from_bytes(pubkey))
    if P is None:
        raise ValueError
    Q = point_add(P, point_mul(G, t))
    return 0 if has_even_y(Q) else 1, bytes_from_int(x(Q))
```

The `taproot_tweak_pubkey` from <a href="/341" target="_blank">BIP341</a> is also used as a helper function.

The following notations are used in the pseudocode below:
*  `n_inputs` and `n_outputs` are the number of inputs and outputs of the transaction, respectively;
*  `inputs[i]` is the i-th input of the transaction;
*  `outputs[i]` is the i-th output of the transaction;
*  `this_input_index`, `this_input_internal_key` and `this_input_taptree` are the index,

```
  taproot internal key and taproot Merkle root of the current input, respectively.
* <code>P2TR(key)</code> computes the scriptPubKey of the P2TR output with the given key as the taproot output key.
```


<h4> Transaction-wide initialization </h4>


This is executed once for the entire transaction, before any of the transaction input's scripts are evaluated.
Itinitializes three arrays that are used to keep track of the amount information of the output.

```
  output_min_amount = [0] * n_outputs
  output_checked_default = [False] * n_outputs
  output_checked_deduct = [False] * n_outputs
```

<h4> Input initialization </h4>


This is executed at the beginning of the evaluation of each input's script. It initializes the residual amount to equal
the full amount of the current input.

```
  residual_input_amount = input[this_input_index].amount
```

<h4> <code>OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY</code> evaluation </h4>


The following code is executed every time the `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` opcode is encountered during the
evaluation of a taproot script spend. `this_input_index`, `this_input_internal_key` and
`this_input_taptree` are the index, taproot internal key and taproot Merkle root of the current input.

`BIP341_NUMS_KEY` is the x-only provably unspendable key `50929b74c1a04954b78b4b6035e97a5e078a5a0f28ec96d547bfee9ace803ac0`

<h2> Implementation </h2>


A reference implementation is provided as a bitcoin-core <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32080" target="_blank">pull request</a>.

<h2> Examples </h2>


This section documents some common script fragments that use `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` for various common
choices of the parameters. Depending on the use case, some of the parameters might be passed via the witness stack.
In these examples, `<>` (empty buffer) and `0` both refer to an empty stack element.

----

Check data embedded in the current input:
```
<data=data>
<index=-1>
<pk=naked_pk>
<taptree=-1>
<mode=-1 (CCV_MODE_CHECK_INPUT)>
OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY
```

This would be used to access the data committed in the current input. The `<data>` parameter, of course,
would be passed via the witness stack.

----

Check that the input with index `in_i` is a specific contract with embedded `input_data`:
```
<data=input_data>
<index=in_i>
<pk=input_i_naked_pk>
<taptree=input_i_taptree>
<mode=-1 (CCV_MODE_CHECK_INPUT)>
OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY
```

This allows introspecting the program (naked key and taptree) and data of another input of the transaction.

----

Check that the output with index `out_i` is a certain contract (pubkey and taptree) with the specified
embedded `<data>`, preserving input amount:
```
<data=data>
<index=out_i>
<pk=output_naked_pk>
<taptree=output_taptree>
<mode=0 (CCV_MODE_CHECK_OUTPUT)>
OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY
```

This allows introspecting an output's program and data, and sending the full residual amount to it. Logically, it can be
thought as a state transition, moving money to a different state, but still under the control of the pre-set rules.
Typically, the `data` would be computed based on the witness stack, while the output program would be
hard-coded in Script.

----

Check that the output with index `out_i` is a P2TR with pubkey `output_pk`, preserving amount:
```
<data=<>>  # no data
<index=out_i>
<pk=output_pk>
<taptree=<>>  # no taptweak
<mode=0 (CCV_MODE_CHECK_OUTPUT)>
OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY
```

Unlike the previous example, here there is no computation over the destination taproot public key, since both
`data` and `taptweak` are omitted.

----

Check that the output with index `out_i` is a certain contract (pubkey and taptree) with the specified
embedded `data`; don't check amount:
```
<data=data>
<index=out_i>
<pk=output_i_naked_pk>
<taptree=output_i_taptree>
<mode=1 (CCV_MODE_CHECK_OUTPUT_IGNORE_AMOUNT)>
OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY
```

**Remark:** amounts are malleable with this check alone; therefore, it is expected that the amount is also checked
with separate introspection opcodes.

----

Check that the amount of the current input is partially sent to the first output (that must have a certain pubkey), and
all the remaining amount is sent to the second output, which has the same internal key and taptree as the current input:
```
<data=<>>     # no data
<index=0>
<pk=<output_0_pk>>
<taptree=<>>  # no tweak
<mode=2 (CCV_MODE_CHECK_OUTPUT_DEDUCT_AMOUNT)>
OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY

<data=<>>     # no data
<index=1>
<pk=-1>
<taptree=-1>
<mode=0 (CCV_MODE_CHECK_OUTPUT)>
OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY
```

**Remark:** in some applications, it might be desirable to check the exact amount of the first output with separate
introspection opcodes.

<h2> Applications </h2>


TODO

<h2> Deployment </h2>


The activation mechanism, and the set of other BIPs to be concurrently deployed, are to be determined.

<h2> Backwards compatibility </h2>


`OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` replaces the witness v1-only opcode OP_SUCCESS187 with stricter verification
semantics. Consequently, scripts using those opcodes which previously were valid will cease to be valid with this change.

Stricter verification semantics for an OP_SUCCESSx opcode are a soft fork, so existing software will be fully functional
without upgrade except for mining and block validation.
