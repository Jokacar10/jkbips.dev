<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP describes modifications to the getblocktemplate JSON-RPC call (<a href="/22" target="_blank">BIP 22</a>) to support segregated witness as defined by <a href="/141" target="_blank">BIP 141</a>.</p>
<h2>Specification</h2>
<h3>Block Template</h3>
<p>The template Object is revised to include a new key:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Key</th><th>Required</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>weightlimit</td><td>No</td><td>Number</td><td>total weight allowed in blocks</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The '!' rule prefix MUST be enabled on the &quot;segwit&quot; rule for templates including transactions with witness data.
In particular, note that even if the client's &quot;rules&quot; list lacks &quot;segwit&quot;, server MAY support old miners by producing a witness-free template and omitting the '!' rule prefix for &quot;segwit&quot; in the template's &quot;rules&quot; list.
If the GBT server does not support producing witness-free templates after its activation, it must also use the '!' rule prefix in the &quot;vbavailable&quot; list prior to activation.</p>
<h4>Transactions Object Format</h4>
<p>The Objects listed in the response's &quot;transactions&quot; key is revised to include these keys:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Key</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>txid</td><td>String</td><td>transaction id encoded in hexadecimal; required for transactions with witness data</td></tr>
<tr><td>weight</td><td>Number</td><td>numeric weight of the transaction, as counted for purposes of the block's weightlimit; if key is not present, weight is unknown and clients MUST NOT assume it is zero, although they MAY choose to calculate it themselves</td></tr>
<tr><td>hash</td><td>String</td><td>reversed hash of complete transaction (with witness data included) encoded in hexadecimal</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Transactions with witness data may only be included if the template's &quot;rules&quot; list (see <a href="/9" target="_blank">BIP 9</a>) includes &quot;segwit&quot;.</p>
<h3>Sigops</h3>
<p>For templates with &quot;segwit&quot; enabled as a rule, the &quot;sigoplimit&quot; and &quot;sigops&quot; keys must use the new values as calculated in <a href="/141" target="_blank">BIP 141</a>.</p>
<h3>Block Assembly with Witness Transactions</h3>
<p>When block assembly is done without witness transactions, no changes are made by this BIP, and it should be assembled as previously.</p>
<p>When witness transactions are included in the block, the primary merkle root MUST be calculated with those transactions' &quot;txid&quot; field instead of &quot;hash&quot;. A secondary merkle root MUST be calculated as per <a href="/141" target="_blank">BIP 141's commitment structure specification</a> to be inserted into the generation (coinbase) transaction.</p>
<p>Servers MUST NOT include a commitment in the &quot;coinbasetxn&quot; key on the template. Clients MUST insert the commitment as an additional output at the end of the final generation (coinbase) transaction. Only if the template includes a &quot;mutable&quot; key (see <a href="/23" target="_blank">BIP 23 Mutations</a>) including &quot;generation&quot;, the client MAY in that case place the commitment output in any position it chooses, provided that no later output matches the commitment pattern.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Segregated witness substantially changes the structure of blocks, so the previous getblocktemplate specification is no longer sufficient.
It additionally also adds a new way of counting resource limits, and so GBT must be extended to convey this information correctly as well.</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Why doesn't &quot;weightlimit&quot; simply redefine the existing &quot;sizelimit&quot;?</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;sizelimit&quot; is already enforced by clients by counting the sum of bytes in transactions' &quot;data&quot; keys.</li>
<li>Servers may wish to limit the overall size of a block, independently from the &quot;weight&quot; of the block.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is &quot;sigoplimit&quot; redefined instead of a new &quot;sigopweightlimit&quot; being added?</p>
<ul>
<li>The old limit was already arbitrarily defined, and could not be counted by clients on their own anyway. The concept of &quot;sigop weight&quot; is merely a change in the arbitrary formula used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is &quot;sigoplimit&quot; divided by 4?</p>
<ul>
<li>To resemble the previous values. (FIXME: is this a good reason? maybe we shouldn't divide it?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is the witness commitment required to be added to the end of the generation transaction rather than anywhere else?</p>
<ul>
<li>Servers which do not allow modification of the generation outputs ought to be checking this as part of the validity of submissions. By requiring a specific placement, they can simply strip the commitment and do a byte-for-byte comparison of the outputs. Placing it at the end avoids the possibility of a later output matching the pattern and overriding it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why shouldn't the server simply add the commitment upfront in the &quot;coinbasetxn&quot;, and simply send the client stripped transaction data?</p>
<ul>
<li>It would become impossible for servers to specify only &quot;coinbasevalue&quot;, since clients would no longer have the information required to construct the commitment.</li>
<li>getblocktemplate is intended to be a <em>decentralised</em> mining protocol, and allowing clients to be blinded to the content of the block works contrary to that purpose.</li>
<li>BIP 23's &quot;transactions&quot; mutations allow the client to modify the transaction-set on their own, which is impossible without the complete transaction data.</li>
</ul>
